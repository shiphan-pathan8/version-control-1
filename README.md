Version Control in Software Development
<br>
-What is version control?
  -Version control - also known as source control or revision control - is an important software development practice for tracking and 
   managing changes made to code and other files. It is closely related to source code management.
-With version control, every change made to the code base is tracked. This allows software developers to see the entire history of who
 changed what at any given time â€” and roll back from the current version to an earlier version if they need to. It also creates a single
 source of truth.
-Version control (or source control or revision control) serves as a safety net to protect the source code from irreparable harm, giving
 the development team the freedom to experiment without fear of causing damage or creating code conflicts.
-The three most well-known version control tools
  -Git:- Git is the most popular option and has become synonymous with "source code management." Git is an open source distributed system
         that is used for software projects of any size, making it a popular option for startups, enterprise, and everything in between.
  -Subversion (SVN):- SVN is a widely adopted centralized VCS. This system keeps all of a project's files on a single codeline making it
                     impossible to branch, so it's easy to scale for large projects. It's simple to learn and features folder security
                     measures, so access to subfolders can be restricted.
  -Mercurial:- Mercurial is a distributed VCS that offers simple branching and merging capabilities. The system enables rapid scaling and
              collaborative development, with an intuitive interface. The flexible command line interface enables users to begin using the
              system immediately.
